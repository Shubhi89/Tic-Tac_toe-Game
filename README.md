# Tic-Tac_toe-Game
I developed a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid, with JavaScript handling the game logic and winner detection. The interface is styled using CSS, and the game allows for smooth resets and dynamic updates after each round.

Description
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the grid, with game logic implemented to detect the winner or a draw. The interface is clean and responsive, offering a seamless experience.

Features
Two-player mode: Players alternate turns marking X's and O's.
Winner detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
Reset functionality: After a game ends, players can reset the grid to play again.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the game board and elements.
CSS: Styling and layout of the game grid.
JavaScript: Handles game logic, player turns, winner detection, and resets.
How to Play
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-link>
Open index.html in your web browser.

Two players take turns clicking on the grid to place their X or O.

The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
