# Tic-Tac_toe-Game
I developed a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid, with JavaScript handling the game logic and winner detection. The interface is styled using CSS, and the game allows for smooth resets and dynamic updates after each round.
